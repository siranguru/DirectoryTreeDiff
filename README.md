# DirectoryTreeDiff

**DirectoryTreeDiff** is a command‑line Python tool that compares a baseline folder structure with an actual folder on disk. The baseline source can be provided either as a tree‑formatted text file (for example, generated using `tree /F`) or as a folder path [Input examples given below]. The tool recursively scans both the baseline and the target folder structures and prints the differences in a tree‑like format.

**Latest application:** AI LLM generated file structure or generative AI based file structure (check the sample input) can be stored as baseline.txt and used to find difference with folder and file existing in your system. 

## Key Features

- **Flexible Baseline Input:**  
  Supply the baseline as a tree‑formatted text file or as a folder.

- **Recursive Comparison:**  
  The tool scans and compares folder structures recursively.

- **Clear Diff Output:**  
  - `(-)` indicates an item is present in the baseline but missing in the actual folder.  
  - `(+)` indicates an item is extra in the actual folder (i.e. not present in the baseline).

- **Simple & Fast:**  
  Quickly identify discrepancies between the expected and actual directory trees.

## Input Explanation

DirectoryTreeDiff accepts one of the following as the baseline input:

1. **Tree‑Formatted Text File:**  
   A plain text file that shows the directory structure in a tree‑like format. This file is typically generated by running the `tree /F` command on Windows or a similar command on other systems.  
   
   **Sample Input:**
   ```plaintext
   /project-sample/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── main/
   │   │   ├── app.py
   │   │   └── config.yaml
   │   ├── utils/
   │   │   ├── helpers.py
   │   │   └── logger.py
   │   └── controllers/
   │       ├── user_controller.py
   │       └── auth_controller.py
   ├── docs/
   │   ├── README.md
   │   └── CHANGELOG.md
   ├── tests/
   │   ├── test_app.py
   │   └── test_utils.py
   └── setup.py
2. **Folder Path:**
  You can also provide a folder path as the baseline input. In this case, the tool will scan the given folder and build its structure using `os.walk` just as it does for the actual folder.

## Output Example
  After comparing the baseline structure with an actual folder, the tool prints the differences in a tree‑like format. For example, if the actual folder is missing the `auth_controller.py` file and has an extra file `debug.log` under `src/main`, the output might look like this:
  
  **Sample Output:**  
    
    └── src
        └── main
            ├── debug.log   (+)
            └── auth_controller.py   (-)
   

 **In the output:**
- `auth_controller.py (-)` indicates that the file `auth_controller.py` is expected (as per the baseline) but is missing in the actual folder.
- `debug.log (+)` indicates that the file `debug.log` is present in the actual folder but is not part of the baseline.


## How It Works

1. **Baseline Parsing:**  
   If a text file is provided, the tool parses the tree‑formatted text into a nested dictionary. If a folder path is provided, it builds the structure using `os.walk`.

2. **Actual Folder Scanning:**  
   The target folder is scanned recursively and represented as a nested dictionary.

3. **Difference Computation:**  
   The two directory trees are compared recursively:
   - Items missing in the actual folder are marked with `(-)`.
   - Items extra in the actual folder are marked with `(+)`.

4. **Output:**  
   The differences are printed to the console in an intuitive tree‑like format with markers appended after item names.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
  
## Run the Script:
  - When the baseline is a text file:
##
      python file_tree_diff.py --baseline "C:\Path\to\baseline.txt" --folder "C:\Path\to\target-folder"

  - When the baseline is a folder:
##
      python file_tree_diff.py --baseline "C:\Path\to\baseline_folder" --folder "C:\Path\to\target-folder"

## Troubleshooting

- **Paths with Spaces:**  
  Enclose file and folder paths in quotes.

- **Permissions:**  
  Ensure you have the necessary read permissions for both the baseline and target folders.
