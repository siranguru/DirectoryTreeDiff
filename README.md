# DirectoryTreeDiff
A command-line tool that compares a baseline folder structure (generated, for example, using tree /F) with an actual directory. DirectoryTreeDiff analyzes the two structures and outputs a tree-like diff, clearly marking missing and extra items. This tool is ideal for quickly spotting discrepancies between expected and current file systems.
